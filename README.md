# Library-Catalog-Software
This is a windows executable application to serve as a library catalog system for your personal library.  It was written in FORTRAN 90 as a proof of concept.

To use the software, you will need to have the "CATALOG.txt" file in the same folder as the executable application.  I would recommend making a desktop shortcut for the executable file.  
The software allows you to add book titles, authors, dates of publication, and categories.  All fields are searchable, and there is a feature to generate a random book.  To delete a book, you will have to open the CATALOG.txt file and manually delete.

Please feel free to send me any feedback or suggestions for improvements, desired features, etc.
